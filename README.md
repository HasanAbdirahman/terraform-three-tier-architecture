# terraform-three-tier-architecture
This repository contains Terraform configurations for deploying a robust three-tier architecture on AWS, designed to separate the frontend, business logic, and data storage layers. It includes the setup of a custom VPC, public and private subnets, security groups, and an RDS database instance, all connected via an application load balancer.
